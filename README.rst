Intro
-----
This is an experiment in self-modifying HTML files, inspired by *TiddlyWiki*.

My idea is to have a to-do list stored entirely in an HTML file.
It might be pretty straightforward, based on this idea.

Instructions
------------
Open *selfie.html* in your web browser, at a URL like
`file:///d/code/selfie/selfie.html`.

Then via your browser, overwrite *selfie.html* with itself. Reload the page, and a second alert should display.
