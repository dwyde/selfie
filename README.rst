Intro
-----
This is an experiment in self-modifying HTML files, inspired by *TiddlyWiki*.

The idea is to have a to-do list stored entirely in an HTML file.

Instructions
------------
Open *selfie.html* in your web browser, at a URL like
`file:///d/code/selfie/selfie.html`.

Add or delete notes. Then, via your browser, overwrite *selfie.html* with itself. Reload the page, and your changes will remain.
